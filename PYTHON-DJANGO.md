### What is document for?

This document is put together by the mentors at MountBlue, for our own students from non python bootcamps like Python, Ruby, Golang, Java, to learn Django and Django Rest Framework on their own. We would be very happy if this helps people other than our students.

### What is django?

This is what the django website says about Django ...

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

### Don't know python?

You need to have working knowledge on python before you proceed on to Django, you know, as Django is build with python.

Generally with everything related to learning programming, the `freeCodeCamp` videos are my go to resource.

1. The [Learn Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) video covers the basics of the python language. 
   It is a long video, four and a half hours. Plan to do it in many chunks. Though every thing is in one long video, it is divided into small sub-topics. Use that to manage your time. And, as always, paractice along with the video.

2. [Intermediate Python Programming Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo)
   Though not strictly necessary for learning Django, this one is strongly recommended. You will learn topics like collections, decorators, and a look at the important parts of the standard library.

### Django Rest Framework

Server Side Rendering is so 2010, What most django developers do is write Web API that support `frontends` written in a JavaScript framework like React or Angular (there are 100s of those out there). This is where Django Rest Framework of DRF comes in.

[This YouTube play list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCYzUzKIBE9Pi8wtx8g55fExDAPXBsbV) is a particularly good introduction.
