### What is document for?

This document is put together by the mentors at MountBlue, for our own students from non Ruby bootcamps like the Python, JavaScript, Golang, Java, to learn Ruby / Ruby on Rails on their own. We would very happy if this helps people other than our students.

### What is Ruby on Rails?

Ruby on Rails or RoR as its popularly called, is a MVC, server-side web application framework. It is the granddaddy of modern web application frameworks, inspiring popular frameworks like Django, Laravel, CakePHP and dozens more. Many Unicorns like Twitter,GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, Zendesk have all been built on RoR.

### Ecosystem

The RoR ecosystem is HUGE. Which is natural considering RoR has been around since 2004. The following are a list of what we think are essential Rails Gems.

1. [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) a flexible authentication system.
2. [Pundit](https://rubygems.org/gems/pundit) Object oriented authorization for Rails applications.
3. [Simple Form](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form) Powerful form handling in Rails.
