### What is document for?

This document is put together by the mentors at MountBlue, for our own students from non "JS Frontend" bootcamps like Python, Ruby, Golang, Java, to learn React on their own. We would be very happy if this helps people other than our students.

### Ecosystem

React on its own, is a great UI library, but the true power or React comes out when used with libraries like ...

1. [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
2. [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
3. [React-Recompose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-recompose)
4. [Redux-Form](https://redux-form.com)
5. [React-Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
6. [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) React Hooks library for data fetching

And many more ...

#### Next.js
Next.js elevates React to the next level with a host of features like server side rendering, etc.

#### Udemy

Udemy has emerged as a rich resource for almost all tech topics. Here are a few courses suggested by our mentors.


1. Suggested by Khaja

   [Complete React Developer in 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/). This one covers Redux and GraphQL as well.

2. Sachin suggests courses by [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/).
   Stephen Grider is prolific course author on Udemy and his courses are good. His course [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) is a good starting point.
