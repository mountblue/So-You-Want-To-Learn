### What is document for?

This document is put together by the mentors at MountBlue, for our own students in non "JS Frontend" bootcamps like the Python, Ruby, Golang, Java ones, to learn React on their own. We would very happy if this helps people other than our students.

### Ecosystem

React on its own is a great UI library, but the true power or React comes out when used with libraries like ...

1. Redux
2. React-Router
3. Recompense
4. Redux-Forms

And many more ...
