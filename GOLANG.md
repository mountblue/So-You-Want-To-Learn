### What is document for?

This document is put together by the mentors at MountBlue, for our own students from non Go bootcamps like Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Java, to learn "Web development with Go" on their own. We would be very happy if this helps people other than our students.

Though there are many web-frameworks in go we will focus on the most popular stack.
1. Gin for API development
2. GORM for DB access
   

### The go language

Go is an open source programming language that aims to combine the ease of programming of interpreted languages like python or ruby with the performance of native languages like c or c++.


The `freeCodeCamp` go tutorial is a great introduction.

This one is the best tutorial available for free.
