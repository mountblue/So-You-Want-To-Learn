### What is document for?

This document is put together by the mentors at MountBlue, for our own students from non python bootcamps like Python, Ruby, Golang, Java, to learn Flask and Flask Rest Framework on their own. We would be very happy if this helps people other than our students.

### What is Flask?

This is what the Flask website says about Flask ...

Flask is a micro-framework writthe in python. What's a micro-framework you ask, a micro-framework concentrates on doing the core functionality of a web framework like http, routing etc. Features that come standard in a full webpframework

### Don't know python?

You need to have working knowledge on python before you proceed on to Flask, you know, as Flask is build with python.

Generally with everything related to learning programming, the `freeCodeCamp` videos are my go to resource.

1. The [Learn Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) video covers the basics of the python language. 
   It is a long video, four and a half hours. Plan to do it in many chunks. Though every thing is in one long video, it is divided into small sub-topics. Use that to manage your time. And, as always, paractice along with the video.

2. [Intermediate Python Programming Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo)
   Though not strictly necessary for learning Flask, this one is strongly recommended. You will learn topics like collections, decorators, and a look at the important parts of the standard library.
